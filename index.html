                        Whenever you want more out of life; you must be willig to suffer, because only thru the
                        suffering will you
                        actually realize that chance you have to change the role of your movie. I have made alot of
                        mistake in my
                        life, and God Wiliing I am going to make alot more. The only true way to find happiness in this
                        world is to
                        let go and stop caring. Some advice that still is very hard for me to do now. But as the great
                        Maya Angelou said we must love ourself enough to overcome on our nightmare as well the world.
                        <a href="https://sgscreed.com/news/2014/05/31/maya-angelou-a-life-of-struggle-and-success/" id="tribute-link">As
                            a women
                            she set the standards of what a phenomenal women should be</a>.Her life and legacy is not
                        of
                        greatness, but simply of Overcoming everything that was put in her direction.
